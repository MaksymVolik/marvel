# Marvel information portal

## A React application using the Marvel API to showcase comics and characters.

### Implemented:
- displaying a random character when the page loads and when a button is pressed;
- receive 20 comics when loading a page;
- loading of the following comics at the touch of a button;
- display information about the character when choosing a comic;
- transition to the page with the comic selected in the character information;
- a form for searching for a character in the Marvel database with validation and subsequent transition to the page with the character;
- a separate page with a list of comics and opening the comic page;

### React:
- react functional components;
- hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef, useMemo);
- creating your own hook (useHttp);
- navigation in the application (React Router 6);
- SEO optimization of web applications (React-helmet);
- working with react libraries (Formik, Yup, React Transition Group)
- lazy loading react components;

### Libraries used:
- Formik - Build forms in React
- React-helmet - managing changes in the document header

- React Transition Group - for animation of entry and exit transitions
- Yup - schema constructor to analyze and validate the value at runtime
